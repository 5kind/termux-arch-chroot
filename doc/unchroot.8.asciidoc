arch-chroot(8)
==============

Name
----
arch-chroot - enhanced chroot command

Synopsis
--------
arch-chroot [options] chroot-dir [command] [arguments...]

Description
-----------
arch-chroot wraps the linkman:chroot[1] command while ensuring that important
functionality is available, e.g. mounting '/dev/', '/proc' and other API
filesystems, or exposing linkman:resolv.conf[5] to the chroot.

If 'command' is unspecified, arch-chroot will launch */bin/bash*.

[NOTE]
======
The target chroot-dir *should* be a mountpoint. This ensures that tools such as
linkman:pacman[8] or linkman:findmnt[8] have an accurate hierarchy of the
mounted filesystems within the chroot. If your chroot target is not a
mountpoint, you can bind mount the directory on itself to make it a mountpoint,
i.e.:

'mount --bind /your/chroot /your/chroot'
======


Options
-------

*-N*::
	Run in unshare mode. This will use linkman:unshare[1] to create a new
	mount and user namespace, allowing regular users to create new system
	installations.

*-u <user>[:group]*::
	Specify non-root user and optional group to use.

*-r*::
	Do not change the resolv.conf within the chroot. This means that the resolver
	might not work in the chroot, which could be the required state.

*-h*::
	Output syntax and command line options.
